# 4thGenCompilerUsingLLM
HingLang is an innovative 4th-generation compiler that blends the deterministic precision of traditional compilers with the adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs). This project integrates Metaâ€™s LLaMA (3.2B parameters) to dynamically interpret ambiguous inputs, generate code, and provide adaptive feedback.
